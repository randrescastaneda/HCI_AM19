The launch of the Human Capital Index (HCI) in October 2018 underscored
a huge gap in human capital outcomes across regions and income groups.
As a measure of the relative productivity of the next generation of
workers, the HCI shows the effectiveness of current investments and the
readiness of a country to be competitive in an increasingly complex
world with constantly changing nature of work. Equally important as a
country's average distance from the frontier is how different
socio-economic groups fare in terms of their relative future
productivity. In a world where rising inequality is a critical policy
issue, narrowing differences in human capital outcomes across
socio-economic groups could be a way to facilitate economic mobility.

This country profile presents the data on disaggregation of HCI and its
components (\textbf{child survival, expected years of school, harmonized
test scores and non-stunted rate}) by socio-economic status. The
objective of this exercise is to look at differences within countries
and is not meant to be comparable with the cross-country HCI values
published earlier. While the exercise employs a similar methodology, it
is different in that it excludes adult survival rate and is based on
household survey based enrolment rates of children ages 6-17. The
disaggregation is available for 51 countries. Given that human capital
outcomes may not be uniquely increasing/decreasing across socio-economic
groups, this country profile provides a comparison of the richest and
poorest 20 percent of households.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Human Capital Index (HCI).} In eSwatini, the productivity as a
  future worker of a child born today in the richest 20 percent of
  households is \textbf{66 percent} while it is \textbf{55 percent} for
  a child born in the poorest 20 percent, a gap of \textbf{11}
  percentage points. This gap is smaller than the typical gap across the
  51 countries (15 percentage points).
\item
  \textbf{Probability of Survival to Age 5.} In eSwatini, the
  probability of survival of a child born today in the richest 20
  percent of households is \textbf{95 percent} while it is \textbf{90
  percent} for a child born in the poorest 20 percent, a gap of
  \textbf{5} percentage points. This gap is slightly larger than the
  typical gap across the 51 countries (4percentage points).
\item
  \textbf{Expected Years of School.} In eSwatini, a child in the richest
  20 percent of households who starts school at age 6 can expect to
  complete \textbf{11.2 years} of school by her 18th birthday while a
  child from the poorest 20 percent can expect to complete \textbf{11
  years} of school, a gap of \textbf{.2 years} of school. This gap is
  smaller than the typical gap across the 51 countries (2.4years).
\item
  \textbf{Harmonized Test Scores.} Students from the richest 20 percent
  of households in eSwatini score \textbf{436} while those from the
  poorest 20 percent score \textbf{408}, a gap of \textbf{28 points}.
  This gap is smaller than the typical gap across the 51 countries
  (56points).
\item
  \textbf{Healthy Growth (Not Stunted Rate).} In eSwatini, the
  percentage of children in the top 20 percent of households who are not
  stunted is \textbf{91 percent} while it is \textbf{70 percent} among
  the poorest 20 percent, a gap of \textbf{21} percentage points. This
  gap is larger than the typical gap across the 51 countries (19
  percentage points).
