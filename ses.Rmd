The launch of the Human Capital Index (HCI) in October 2018 underscored a huge gap in human capital outcomes across regions and income groups. As a measure of the relative productivity of the next generation of workers, the HCI shows the effectiveness of current investments and the readiness of a country to be competitive in an increasingly complex world with constantly changing nature of work. Equally important as a country's average distance from the frontier is how different socio-economic groups fare in terms of their relative future productivity. In a world where rising inequality is a critical policy issue, narrowing differences in human capital outcomes across socio-economic groups could be a way to facilitate economic mobility.

This country profile presents the data on disaggregation of HCI and its components (**child survival, expected years of school, harmonized test scores and non-stunted rate**) by socio-economic status. The objective of this exercise is to look at differences within countries and is not meant to be comparable with the cross-country HCI values published earlier. While the exercise employs a similar methodology, it is different in that it excludes adult survival rate and is based on household survey based enrolment rates of children ages 6-17. The disaggregation is available for 51 countries. Given that human capital outcomes may not be uniquely increasing/decreasing across socio-economic groups, this country profile provides a comparison of the richest and poorest 20 percent of households.
