The launch of the World Bank Human Capital Index (HCI) in October 2018 highlighted large gaps in human capital outcomes across 157 countries around the world.  This global HCI shows how shortfalls in health and education among children today will reduce the productivity of the next generation of workers. 

Gaps in human capital outcomes within countries across socioeconomic groups are large as well.  This country profile documents these within-country gaps using a newly-developed version of the HCI disaggregated by socioeconomic status.  It presents data on key indicators of human capital outcomes among the young (child survival, expected years of school, harmonized test scores, and the fraction of children under 5 who are not stunted) broken down by quintiles of socioeconomic status, together with a version of the HCI by quintiles, for 51 low- and middle-income countries.  

This version of the HCI disaggregated by socioeconomic status uses the same general methodology as the global HCI, but uses different data sources in order to allow for this disaggregation, and so is not directly comparable with the global HCI.   For details on the data and methodology of the HCI disaggregated by socioeconomic status, see [INSERT TITLE AND LINK TO REPORT]

* **Human Capital Index (HCI).** In Ethiopia, the productivity as a future worker of a child born today in the richest 20 percent of households is **52 percent** while it is **39 percent** for a child born in the poorest 20 percent, a gap of **13** percentage points. This gap is smaller than the typical gap across the 51 countries (15 percentage points).  

* **Probability of Survival to Age 5.** In Ethiopia, the probability of survival of a child born today in the richest 20 percent of households is **93 percent** while it is **91 percent** for a child born in the poorest 20 percent, a gap of **2** percentage points. This gap is smaller than the typical gap across the 51 countries (4 percentage points).  

* **Expected Years of School.** In Ethiopia, a child in the richest 20 percent of households who starts school at age 6 can expect to complete **9.3** years of school by her 18th birthday while a child from the poorest 20 percent can expect to complete **5.9** years of school, a gap of **3.4 years** of school. This gap is larger than the typical gap across the 51 countries (2.4 years).

* **Harmonized Test Scores.** Students from the richest 20 percent of households in Ethiopia score **388** while those from the poorest 20 percent score **347**, a gap of **41 points** on a scale that ranges from 300 (minimal attaintment) to 625 (high attainment). This gap is smaller than the typical gap across the 51 countries (56 points).

* **Healthy Growth (Not Stunted Rate).** In Ethiopia, the percentage of children in the top 20 percent of households who are **not** stunted is **75 percent** while it is **55 percent** among the poorest 20 percent, a gap of **20 percentage points**. This gap is slightly larger han the typical gap across the 51 countries (19 percentage points).
